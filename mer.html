                <hr>
                <p class="card-text">In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat
                  vacated when former District B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position.
                  After the November election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which
                  Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out the balance of Head's term, and was
                  unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.

                  As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She introduced
                  a bill banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of
                  secondhand smoke on service industry workers. The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.

                  Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected to
                  by residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was
                  moved to the downtown site of the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with
                  at-large council member Jason Williams to register and inspect rental units in the city.

                  As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install crime
                  cameras in her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address
                  understaffing at the New Orleans Police Department.

                  Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace
                  term-limited mayor Mitch Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates.
                  Cantrell garnered the most votes, winning 39% of the total. In the November 18 runoff election,
                  Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic opponent Desiree Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of
                  the vote. She is the first woman to lead New Orleans in its 300-year history, as well as the first
                  mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.

                  Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                  history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating
                  a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence
                  Reduction Council tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate
                  hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative
                  to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that
                  initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufactures
                  and distributors.
