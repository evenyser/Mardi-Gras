                  The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                  schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                  earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well
                  known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for
                  naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for
                  naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly
                  African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws
                  are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
                  inexpensive toys, but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the
                  same parade schedule and route each year.

                  While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans and
                  Dauphin, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St.
                  Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day
                  traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

                  The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River
                  in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
                  men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of
                  the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with
                  music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt A Company Man - The Book An
                  account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing
                  of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were
                  quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de
                  Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official
                  Mardi Gras celebration.

                  James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans
                  Mardi Gras in 1835:

                  Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                  frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active
                  operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert
                  themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and
                  disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads;
                  demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon;
                  mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons,
                  carts, coaches, cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing,
                  laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless
                  way.

                  In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                  observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick
                  Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what
                  New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than
                  this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a
                  certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans
                  'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess
                  helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival
                  passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the
                  nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to
                  compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans
                  culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."

                  In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
                  conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
                  Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

                  In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved
                  to surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than
                  usual came to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard
                  troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt
                  to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter
                  bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

                  In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
                  Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion,
                  gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the
                  law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to
                  the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In
                  protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private
                  membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the
                  1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in
                  2000.

                  Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                  federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First
                  Amendment rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups
                  subject to the ordinance.[7] The US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this
                  decision.

                  Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                  dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.
