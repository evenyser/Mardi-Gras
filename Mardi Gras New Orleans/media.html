              <h3>They’re Wearing Mardi Gras Beads at the Pearly Gates.
              </h3>
              <p>June 26, 2020</p>
              <br>
              <p>On Thursday, June 25, 2020, New Orleans lost “Mr. Mardi Gras,” famous parade/float designer Blaine Kern
                Sr. He was 93. According to MardiGrasNewOrleans.com founder Judy Weitz, Kern’s contribution to modern
                Mardi Gras is “unmatched.” </p>
              <p>“New Orleans has many famous musicians, chefs and writers," Weitz said, "But there’s only been one Mr.
                Mardi Gras and that was Blaine Kern."</p>
              <p>Since 1947, Kern and his company Kern Studios have designed and built floats for some of the most
                popular parades in Carnival history, including Rex, Zulu, Bacchus, Endymion, Orpheus and Muses. Kern and
                his team introduced the world to double-decker floats, multi-unit tandem floats, giant animated prop
                figures, animatronics and flashing lighting.</p>
              <p>According to Carnival historian Errol Laborde, Kern was “a combination of Michelangelo and P.T.
                Barnum.”</p>
              <p>And Mardi Gras expert Arthur Hardy said, "It didn't stop." At 92, Kern could still draw. He would
                create caricatures of people on napkins while Hardy and Kern would be sitting at a table eating. "It's
                hard to mention him and not smile," Hardy was quoted as saying. "He lit up a room."</p>
              <p>For Rex, Kern’s creations included the Boeuf Gras, the Jester and King’s float. For Bacchus, he
                designed the King Kong family, Bacchagator and Bacchasaurus. Orpheus fans can thank him for the
                Leviathan and Smokey Mary. Kern was also behind the floats that carry Zulu’s king and other beloved
                characters, as well signature floats for Endymion and Muses.</p>
              <p>Over the years, the companies run by Kern and his family produced parades for several more krewes in
                the area and along the Gulf Coast. In addition, they’ve done work for Universal Studios, the Walt Disney
                Company, Six Flags and other theme parks all over the world.</p>
              <p>In 2008, Kern moved Mardi Gras World, the popular tourist attraction he opened in Algiers in 1984, to
                its current site near the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. Thanks to him, visitors can get a taste of
                Mardi Gras, and even a piece of king cake, all year long.</p>

              <h3>Covid-19 Affects Beloved Mardi Gras Indian Tribe.</h3>
              <P>June 11, 2020 </P>
              <br>
              <p>Yeah, New Orleans is the birthplace of jazz. Yeah, our festivals are the best in the world. Yeah,
                nobody makes gumbo and red beans and rice like we do.</p>
              <p>But the thing that really makes us who we are is our people. Why? Because we not only embrace our
                culture but we keep our traditions alive for the generations to come. The Wild Magnolias, a Mardi Gras
                Indian tribe founded in the 1950s, is a perfect example of that.</p>
              <p>At the age of nine, Bo Dollis, Jr., the son of then Big Chief Bo Dollis, Sr., took his mama’s beaded
                purse without asking and cut it up to make his first suit.</p>
              <p>Lucky for him, his mother let it slide.</p>
              <p>Lucky for us, Bo’s love for all things Wild Magnolias survives to this day.</p>
              <p>"It was always in my blood," Bo said. "I have brothers and sisters but I'm the only one who masks."<p>
                  <p>Bo, Jr. became Big Chief after his father’s passing in 2015, and today he’s more devoted to the
                    tribe than ever. Bo has been masking for 28 years now and shows no signs of hanging up his
                    tambourine. That’s not to say it’s been all moonlight and magnolias however.</p>
                  <p>"This has been a tough year for The Wild Magnolias," Bo said. "One of our members recently survived
                    a battle with Covid-19 that put him in a coma for two months. Another member is risking her life
                    daily as a nurse on the front line. And several members have been laid off from their jobs, many in
                    the hospitality industry."</p>
                  <p>The Wild Magnolias Band is feeling the effects of the Coronavirus, too. They’ve lost a number of
                    gigs like festivals, concerts, weddings, and even recording sessions. The band, who is a fixture at
                    Jazz Fest and has even played Carnegie Hall, is now social distancing like the rest of us, mostly at
                    home. This gives them plenty of time to sew, but more than time and creativity go into these suits.
                    It takes money.</p>
                  <p>According to Bo, it costs $400 for a pound of plumes alone, and one suit can require up to five
                    pounds. And that doesn’t even include all the beads, the stones and everything else you need to be
                    the prettiest Indian out there on Mardi Gras day and Super Sunday.</p>
                  <p>That’s where you come in. The Wild Magnolias is asking for donations that will go towards their
                    suits for the year of 2021. Anything helps, but donors who give $100 or more will have their names
                    placed in a drawing to win one detailed beaded patch, an autographed Wild Magnolias CD, and a Jazz
                    and Heritage Fest poster of Big Chief Bo Dollis, Sr.</p>
                  <p>New Orleans wouldn’t be New Orleans without The Wild Magnolias. Now’s the time to help. Keep The
                    Mask On! Visit The Wild Magnolias' GoFundMe Page today and do what you can.</p>
